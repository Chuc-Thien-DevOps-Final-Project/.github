# ‚òïÔ∏è Go CoffeeShop Deployment Organization

## üè¢ Organization Purpose

This GitHub organization was created to support the final DevOps assignment for my internship. The goal is to provision, deploy, and operate a microservices-based web application called **Go CoffeeShop** üöÄ in both **development** and **production** environments using DevOps practices.

    * ‚úçÔ∏è Automatically updating the image tag in `docker-compose.yml` and Kubernetes YAML manifests.
    * üîî Notifications upon pipeline completion.
* **CD (Continuous Delivery)** is implemented via **Argo CD** following a **GitOps pull-based model**.

## **1.4. üìä Monitoring**

* The system is monitored using **Datadog**.
* Key performance indicators (KPIs) are collected, including:
    * CPU Utilization
    * Memory Utilization
    * HTTP Request Statistics (4xx Client Errors / 5xx Server Errors)
    * HPA Status
* üö® Alert if:
    * üìà HPA current replicas `>=` HPA max replicas
    * ‚ö†Ô∏è CPU Usage exceeds 80% threshold
    * ‚ö†Ô∏è 5xx Server Errors are occurring

## ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Application Homepage**

### **Application overview**:
The CoffeeShop application appears to be a web application designed to manage ordering and payments within a coffee shop, allows users to:
- View and select products available on the coffee shop's menu (likely seen on the [Home screen](#homescreen-image)).
- Make payments for their orders easily and conveniently (as shown on the [Payment screen](#paymentscreen-image)).
- Track their order history (displayed on the [Order list screen](#orderlistscreen-image)).

## **3. Architecture Diagrams**

Here are descriptions of the architecture diagrams for the CoffeeShop application:

### 3.1. Kubernetes Application Architecture Diagram

![Kubernetes Application Architecture](images/chart_k8s.jpg)

This diagram illustrates the Kubernetes-based architecture of the CoffeeShop application. It depicts the flow of traffic from a user accessing the application through a DNS (likely `ops-wat.chucthien.click`) which resolves to a Traefik ingress controller within a Kubernetes cluster.

The diagram shows the following key components:

* **Traefik:** Acting as an ingress controller, routing external traffic to the appropriate services within the cluster. It handles HTTP (`opswat.chucthien.click:80`) (HTTPS later ...)
* **Web Frontend:** A pod running the web frontend of the application, exposed on port 8888. It scales up/down based on CPU utilization.
* **Proxy:** Another pod acting as a proxy, potentially for internal communication or handling specific requests, exposed on port 5000. It also scales up/down based on CPU utilization.
* **Product Service:** A set of pods running the product catalog service, communicating on port 5001.
* **Counter Service:** A set of pods running a counter service, communicating on port 5002.
* **RabbitMQ:** A RabbitMQ message broker, accessed via `rabbitmq:5672`.
* **Barista Service**: A set of pods representing the barista application logic.
* **Kitchen Service**: A set of pods representing the kitchen application logic.
* * **External Secrets Operator:** This component interacts with AWS Secrets Manager to retrieve sensitive information (External Secret) needed by the application.

The diagram highlights the internal communication between different microservices within the Kubernetes cluster and how external requests are routed to the frontend. It also shows the dependency on external services like Traefik, RabbitMQ, AWS Elastic LoadBalancer and AWS Secrets Manager.

### 3.2. AWS Infrastructure Architecture Diagram

![AWS Infrastructure Architecture](images/chart_aws.jpg)

This diagram outlines the AWS infrastructure supporting the CoffeeShop application. It shows a multi-Availability Zone (AZ) setup within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Key components depicted include:

* **User:** Accessing the application via `https://ops-wat.chucthien.click`.
* **Route 53:** AWS's scalable DNS service, routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer (CLB).
* **AWS Certificate Manager:** Used to provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.
* **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Provisioning by Traefik 
* **Availability Zones:** The architecture spans across two Availability Zones for increased resilience.
* **Public Subnets:** Contain resources that need to be accessible from the internet, such as the CLB and potentially Bastion Hosts (for check service in private subnets).
* **Private Subnets:** Contain more sensitive resources that should not be directly exposed to the internet, such as the Amazon RDS database and EC2 instances running the application's containers (within an EKS cluster).
* **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):** A managed Kubernetes service in AWS, likely hosting the application's containers.
* **EC2 Instances (Containers):** EC2 instances running the application's containerized workloads.
* **Bastion Hosts:** Securely provisioned EC2 instances used to access resources in the private subnets.
* **Amazon Relational Database Service (PosgreSQL):** A managed relational database service.
* **Security Group:** Controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the EC2 instances and other resources.

This diagram emphasizes the high availability and security aspects of the AWS infrastructure, utilizing load balancing, multiple availability zones, and private subnets to protect the application and its data.

### 3.3. CI/CD and Monitoring Workflow Diagram

![CI/CD and Monitoring Workflow](images/chart_cicd.jpg)

This diagram illustrates the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline and the monitoring workflow for the CoffeeShop application.

The CI/CD pipeline starts with code changes being pushed to **GitHub**. This triggers a **Trigger Pipeline** managed by **GitHub Actions**. The pipeline includes steps like:

* **CI Pipeline:**
    * **Trigger**: when a TAG pushed with the pattern **v*** ex: v1.01, v2.9
    * **Trivy Scan Image:** Scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities.
    * **Login AWS:** Authenticating with AWS.
    * **Push Image with new tag to ECR:** Pushing the newly built and scanned Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
    * **Update manifest and create PR:** Updating Kubernetes manifests with the new image tag and creating a Pull Request (PR) for review.
    * **Email/Notification:** Sending notifications about the CI process.
* **CD Pipeline (Dev Environment):**
    * **Provision Dev Environment:** Setting up or updating the development environment.
    * **Setup Dev Environment:** Configuring the development environment.
    * **Install Docker, Install Docker Compose, AWS Login:** Ensuring necessary tools are installed.
    * **Docker Compose Up:** Deploying the application in the development environment using Docker Compose.
    * **Email/Notification:** Sending notifications about the CD process in the development environment.
* **CD Pipeline (Prod Environment):**
    * * **ArgoCD:** a GitOps continuous delivery tool, pulling changes and syncing the application state in the **EKS - Prod Environment**.

The monitoring workflow involves:

* **Datadog Agent:** Running within the EKS production environment to collect metrics.
* **Push Metric:** Sending collected metrics to **Datadog** for monitoring and analysis.
* **Alert:** Datadog triggers alerts based on defined thresholds.
* **Email/Notification:** Sending alerts via email.

This diagram highlights the automated processes for building, testing, deploying, and monitoring the CoffeeShop application, emphasizing security scanning, GitOps principles, and centralized monitoring with Datadog.
